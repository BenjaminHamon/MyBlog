            <p>Hi! I'm Benjamin Hamon.</p>
            <p>I'm a thirty-two-year-old French guy who worked as a software engineer in the video game industry for about a decade. While it was an enjoyable and comfortable job, I never really felt like it was the path I had actively chosen; I wanted to do something else.
            <p>I've loved books and stories forever. I read a bunch of fantasy epics, and I spent my time between books, tv shows, and video games. At school, I was this guy who stayed by himself and carried around a thousand-page book. My favorite books are the <em>Wheel Of Time</em> series.</p>
            <p>I've had a hobby of writing since about as long as I've been reading. I wrote short stories, fan fiction, and random chapters for epic novels. However, I never finished or published a book for thirty years, far from it, but Iâ€™ve always loved writing. And then, I decided to get serious about it.</p>
            <p>I'm self-publishing my first complete book ever, <em>The Maze Of Your Mind</em>, in October 2023. I hope you'll consider picking it up. I'll be there writing more books, and maybe I'll post a blog entry. Once in a while.</p>

            <p>This blog features my long streams of thought about fiction and storytelling. I'm not particularly interested in rating media, good or bad; rather I try to write about some aspects I found noteworthy, and I go beyond the initial ideas and impressions. Everything here is subjective opinion and attempt at discussion. Hopefully you'll find enjoyment and meaning here.</p>
            <p>The website does not include social media or comments, however feel free to continue the discussion on social media or elsewhere, and maybe poke me so I can have a look. You can reach out to me by mail at <a href="mailto:blog@benjaminhamon.com">blog@benjaminhamon.com</a>. Please also message me if you notice any mistake. Finally, if you like what you read, please share it with people around you. I'm thankful for your time and support.</p>
